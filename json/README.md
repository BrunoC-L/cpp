# JSON

you can use ' instead of " for strings! of course its not true json if you do that but it will parse fine with this class, which is nice because you can write your strings without having to do: "\"something bla bla\"", just do: "'something bla bla'", also no need to indicate that its a string you can just do json = "some string" and it will be fine, no need for "'some string'"
